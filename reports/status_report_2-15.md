# Status Report 2/6
## Team Report
#### Previous Goals
We want to have a working beta by 2/14, and should have revised the Living Doc for submission with it. We also need to make the slides for the presentation.
#### Progress
We completed the project on time, and got the presentation recorded. The Living Doc was also fixed up.
#### New Goals
We need to start implementing the remaining features that were not working in the beta. We also need the solidify the documentation.

## Individual Reports

### Dylan Frohberg
#### Previous Goals
I need to add the controller and test to the README as well as finish implementing the FeatureExtractor component. I also plan to help on the assignment for the next week.
#### Progress
I fixed the Living Doc so it no longer used future tense except for the cases where it was actually talking about future events. I also removed as much ambiguous language as I could find. I finished setting up the Controller so that it parses TXT and PDF documents.
#### New Goals
I want to build on what is already there, specifically, I want to get DOCX and DOC parsing working, as well as add to the result analysis fed back to the website. I also want to see if I can improve the file processing so that there are more features to process.
