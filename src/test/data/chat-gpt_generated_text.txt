It wasn't until I started volunteering at a local non-profit organization that I realized how technology could make a significant impact in the community.

I have been volunteering with a local non-profit for the past two years. The organization provides basic necessities to people experiencing homelessness, and I have seen firsthand how technology can help bridge the gap between those in need and the services that can assist them. For example, the organization uses social media to raise awareness about its programs and to reach a broader audience. It also uses data analysis to track which services are most in demand and how to distribute resources effectively.

Through my experiences with this non-profit, I have come to realize that I want to pursue a degree in computer science to use technology to help people. I believe that the University of Washington is the best place for me to achieve this goal.

The University of Washington's computer science program has an excellent reputation and offers a wide range of courses that would allow me to explore my interests. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, and I am excited to learn from the professors at UW who are leading research in this field.

Moreover, UW's commitment to community engagement aligns with my values. I am impressed by the university's efforts to address social and environmental issues, such as its Sustainable Campus initiative and the work of the Information School's Technology & Social Change Group. I believe that I can contribute to these efforts through my passion for technology and my desire to create a more equitable world.

In summary, I am excited about the opportunity to study computer science at the University of Washington. I believe that my experiences with the non-profit have prepared me to use technology to create positive change in the community, and I am eager to learn from the talented faculty at UW. I am confident that I will thrive in this challenging and supportive academic environment and contribute to the university's mission of making a difference in the world.
