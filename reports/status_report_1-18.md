# Status Report 1/18
## Team Report
#### Previous Goals
None this week as just starting project.
#### Progress
The members of the team have all met each other and discussed our skillsets. We have roughly established an outline for the project and populated the living document with that information. The meetings have generally worked, but there were some communication problems that stymied progress. In the future, we will need to pay more attention to Slack and when planning use concrete dates and times.
#### New Goals
We all need to set up our programming environments, and gain familiarity with any APIs that we have not used before. We also need to populate our repo with the basic instructions and info corresponding to our setup and finish the Git assignment.

## Individual Reports

### Dylan Frohberg

#### Previous Goals
None this week as just starting project.

#### Progress
I helped work on the living document and determine the software architecture we plan to use. I've also attended all the meetings we have had thus far. However, I feel like I could have taken more initiative over the MLKJ weekend and encouraged the team to meet to finish the living document then. I was waiting on someone else to start the conversation when I should have started it myself.

#### New Goals
I need to install the appropriate APIs and set up my Python environment within PyCharm. I also need to sync up with the Github repo. Finally, I want to read/review the API docs and experiment with them, particularly Huggingface, since I have not used it before.

### Simon Struthers

#### Previous Goals

#### Progress
I worked on living document and determined which front-end and back-end architecture we'll be using.

#### New Goals
1. Figure out where and how to host our website in the cloud.
2. Create a skeleton for the back-end code.
