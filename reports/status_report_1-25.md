# Status Report 1/18
## Team Report
#### Previous Goals
We all need to set up our programming environments, and gain familiarity with any APIs that we have not used before. We also need to populate our repo with the basic instructions and info corresponding to our setup and finish the Git assignment.
#### Progress
A .yml file to allow the programming environment to be set up via Conda has been created. We have filled in the necessary parts of the repo for the Git assignment, and have adjusted plans to account for prototyping to familiarize ourselves with new APIs.
#### New Goals
We must add three new sections to the Living Doc as part of next weeks assignment. To do that we need to finalize our plans with the software architecture and establish coding guidelines. Additionally, we would like to have a basic data set for cursory tests collected. 

## Individual Reports
### Dylan Frohberg
#### Previous Goals
I need to install the appropriate APIs and set up my Python environment within PyCharm. I also need to sync up with the Github repo. Finally, I want to read/review the API docs and experiment with them, particularly Hugging Face, since I have not used it before.
#### Progress
I created the .yml file and have read some of the doc for the Hugging Face API, which was the one I was completely unfamiliar with. I also helped to make a number of the changes to our Living Doc and adjust our plans. I think I did a better job at taking the initiative this week, but at the same time I am still not clear about my exact duties at the time of writing this.
#### New Goals
I would like to set up the basic skeleton for my part of the project and need to complete my portion of next week's assignment.
