write me a college personal statement essay for the university of Washington (UW). 

I'm starting on my senior year this fall, and I think I may be able to graduate early this year. I don't think I even see myself in it. I just know that the only thing that I want to accomplish here is to get things right on the job rather than trying to do something that others seem to think would be worth doing. At my current rate of progress, I'll be doing some basic background editing, I think that will serve the project to a tee, but there's still a way to go before I get the opportunity to get there!

As far as class as that is concerned: I am a very introspective kid with an aptitude for doing very small things, not at all in front of huge screens, like my old elementary school. This is a major cause of frustration for me, but I do have my struggles. I have to overcome those feelings when I think I might be out of position or something so that I leave. If I wasn't in any way obligated to complete one project, I would be working without pay, instead of on a small dime. A small day or two on my current job does wonders at solving my difficult problems. It's not a big deal to me. My job just means making sure I have the opportunity to focus on the things I like to do, rather than putting up with it when I don't give myself that opportunity
